Demo contains 2 solutions:
- [DemoCortex](https://github.com/x3mxray/Cortex.Demo.Forecast/tree/master/DemoCortex)
- [MLServer](https://github.com/x3mxray/Cortex.Demo.Forecast/tree/master/MLServer)

## Business value

* It is a benchmark. You can use it as the business as usual level you are going to achieve if nothing changes in your strategy.
* You can calculate the incremental value of your new actions on top of this benchmark.
* It can be utilized for planning. You can plan your demand and supply actions by looking at the forecasts. It helps to see where to invest more.
* It is an excellent guide for planning budgets and targets.


# How to Deploy #

## Pre-requisites
Sitecore 9.1.0 (for 9.1.1 and higher versions package references in project should be updated to corresponding versions)

## Sitecore
* Install the sitecore package [Forecast module-1.0.zip](https://github.com/x3mxray/Cortex.Demo.Forecast/blob/master/install/Forecast_module-1.0.zip)
* Deploy marketing definitions (*Outcomes* is enough)
* Rebuild *sitecore_master_index*

## xConnect and jobs
* Extract and copy [xconnect](https://github.com/x3mxray/Cortex.Demo.Forecast/tree/master/install/xconnect.zip) to your xConnect instance
* Restart xConnect instance and xconnect jobs in windows services

# Populate xConnect with testing data #
* Build solution.
* Run Demo.Project.DemoDataExplorer.exe from project [Demo.Project.DemoDataExplorer](https://github.com/x3mxray/Cortex.Demo.Forecast/tree/master/DemoCortex/src/Project/DemoDataExplorer/code)
![Data Explorer](https://github.com/x3mxray/Cortex.Demo.Forecast/blob/master/documentation/images/DataExplorer.jpg)
* Copy your sitecore website root url to "API address"
* Click "Browse" and select [Online Retail.xlsx](https://github.com/x3mxray/Cortex.Demo.Forecast/blob/master/install/Online_Retail.xlsx) (~500k records)
* Click "Upload file". Wait for finishing uploading process (it takes ~10 min). During process you can see logs in sitecore instance and new contacts appearance in Experience Profile:
```
INFO  Excel import: 272 from 4339: CustomerID=15332
```

# Run ML server #
* Run [MLServer solution](https://github.com/x3mxray/Cortex.Demo.Forecast/tree/master/MLServer) in IIS Express (or install it as IIS application)
* Make sure that it is accessible by requesting http://localhost:56399/api/forecast

# Configure Machine learning endpoints #
* For Sitecore instance: change setting **MlHostUrl** in *App_Config\Include\Project\Demo.Forecast.config*
* For Processing Engine: change option **MLServerUrl** in *xconnect\App_Data\jobs\continuous\ProcessingEngine\App_Data\Config\Sitecore\Processing\sc.Processing.Services.MLNet.xml*

# Run processing task #
- POST request to http://sitecoreInstance.url/api/contactapi/RegisterTasks with POSTMAN
- Or change processing agent sleep period in [Processing Engine -> sc.Processing.Engine.DemoAgents.xml](https://github.com/x3mxray/Cortex.Demo.Forecast/blob/master/DemoCortex/src/Foundation/ProcessingEngine/code/App_Config/Processing/Demo/sc.Processing.Engine.DemoAgents.xml)
- All processes execution takes ~10 minutes (~500k records). During process you can see logs in Processing Engine job:
